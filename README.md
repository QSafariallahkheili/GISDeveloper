# Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction

The model was developed by four parameters inside the dataset includin 'sqft_living', 'sqft_above', 'sqft_living15', 'bathrooms'. The whole process was done in "modelling.ipynb".
Then, the Pickle package was exploited to use the developed model for prediction the house price of a new dataset and visualizing the result.
You can run the "implementation.ipynb" locally to see the result.
